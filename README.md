# SensAI backend

SensAI is an AI-first Learning Management System (LMS) which enables educators to help them teacher smarter and reach further. SensAI coaches your students through questions that develop deeper thinkingâ€”just like you would, but for every student and all the time. This repository is the backend for SensAI. The frontend repository can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/hvacademy/sensai-frontend).
