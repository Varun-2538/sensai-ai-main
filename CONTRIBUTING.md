You can contribute to SensAI in many ways:

1. Contribute code by adding features or fixing bugs: First, set up the code locally on your system following the instructions in `README.md`. Then, check out our [public roadmap](https://hyperverge.notion.site/fa1dd0cef7194fa9bf95c28820dca57f?v=ec52c6a716e94df180dcc8ced3d87610). You can pick up tasks from the `Not Started` or `Backlog` sections (which includes both feature requests and bugs reported) and make a Pull Request. You can join our [WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LmiulDbWpcXIgqNK6fZyxe) of builders in AI + Education and ask any questions that you might have or engage in the discussions, helping other fellow contributors and sharing your ideas/thoughts.
2. Add/improve documentation: This is no less important than improving the library itself. If you find a typo in the documentation, or if you feel that the readability of the code/documentation can be improved, do not hesitate to submit a pull request.
3. Report issues you are facing [either by [creating an issue](https://gitlab.com/hvacademy/sensai-ai/-/issues) or sharing it in our WhatsApp community], and give a "thumbs up" on issues reported by others that are relevant to you. 
4. If you are a teacher or a non-profit, you can test SensAI with your learners and provide valuable feedback.
5. Spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles, link to it from your website, or simply star it.
6. Give us feedback on how we can do better, in general.
