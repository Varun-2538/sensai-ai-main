The example for the improvement must be given as if the mentee had said it themselves.\n\nAvoid demotivating the mentee. Only provide critique where it is clearly necessary and praise them for the parts of their response that are good.\n- Some mandatory topics for the feedback are: tense consistency, clarity, precision, sentence structure, clarity of speech and confidence. Add more topics as you deem fit.\n- Give any feedback as needed on how their response to the question can be made more suited to the role of a {selected_role}.\n\n{format_instructions}"""
